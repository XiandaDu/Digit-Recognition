# Digit Recognition Project

This is a Python 3.11 project which implements digit recognition
using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset utilized is MNIST. 
It contains handwritten digit images for training and validating the
model's digit classification capabilities. 

## Project Structure
```
├── data/MNIST/raw
│   └── handwritten images used for training and testing.
│
├── frontend/digit_recog_frontend
│   └── frontend implementation of the model. It is a react projecct. 
│       See the README file in this folder for details. 
│                            
├── export.py (Converts a trained PyTorch model into an ONNX model.)

├── Main.ipynb (The Jupyter Notebook code. The model was firstly written in Jupyter, 
│               then converted into python code. It is equivalent to main.py.)
│                             
├── main.py (Contains the implementation of the CNN, the training, and the testing. )
│
├── model.py (The ONNX model generated by export.py.)
│
└── model_weights.pth (Trained PyTorch model params will be saved as model_weights.pth.)
```

## Dependencies
* torch
* torchvision
* numpy

You can install the required dependencies using the following command
``` bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy
```

## Running the Project
1. <b>Install Dependencies</b>: Ensure that you have installed the required dependencies.
2. <b>Run the Code<\b>: Execute the main.py file in the project's root directory.
3. <b>Save Model<\b>: The result parameters of the model in the training will be saved in <i>model_weights.pth</i>. 
Run the <i>export.py</i> file to export the model as onnx. 

## Project Overview
### Model Structure
The project utilizes a simple Convolutional Neural Network named <i>CNN</i> in main.py.
``` python
class CNN(nn.module):
    # ...(Model architecture)
```

### Training and Testing
The training and testing functions are defined in main.py after the definition of the CNN model
``` python
def train(epoch):
    #... (Training function)
    
def test():
    #... (Testing function)
```

### Postscript
The accuracy rate of running the test image dataset is around 98%. 

However, it demonstrates difficulty in distinguishing 7 and 1 in real testing.
